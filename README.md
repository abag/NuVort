Description
===========
This is the frontpage for the NuVort code manual; a vortex filament code for quantised vortices in superfluid Helium. The code is written in well commented FORTRAN and is supported by a wealth of MATLAB scripts for post-processing. A Barnes and Hut style tree approximation is used to improve the efficiency of the numerics. If you are interested in using the code for your own research please contact me for more details.
